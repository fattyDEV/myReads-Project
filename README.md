# MyReads Project

This project is for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project is to learn how to take static code with HTML and CSS and run the necessary React code that is needed to complete the project. The goal was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the provided static code.

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## How It Works

Use this App to track books that you are reading, want to read, and have read. Use the menu to move the books around based on whether or not you have read them. You can also click on the plus button to open a search page and add new books to your App.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
